## 💡 Key Insight

The one idea or mental model that unlocked the solution.
I tried iteration on left pointer first, ended up getting answer right but it's prone to error, and for that I has to initiate my right boundary as -1.
Need to remember the more intuitive way is to iterate on right boundary and shrink the left boundary as needed. Keep left boundary in place.
