## 💡 Key Insight

Need to be familiar with topological sorting. Coding is not hard. The idea is to find the node with in degree equal to 0 and push it to a que.

- first we compute the graph, using a map to show u connect to a list of v(s), and store each node's in degree in a map
- loop through nodes, if in degree is 0, push it to que
- shift from the que,which is a node of 0 in degree, push it to result array, and loop through the nodes this node connect to using graph. reduce the in degree of those nodes by 1; If those nodes have 0 in degree, unshift to que for later handling
- if result's length is n. then we good. otherwise there's a cycle in the graph.
