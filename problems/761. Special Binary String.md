## 💡 Key Insight

Problem can be translated to a parenthesis problem, or view it as mountain problem. The key insight is to swap mountain ( close pair of parenthesis), and run recursion on the inner content of parenthesis. Outside the recursion, we sort the mountains in reverse order and concatenate them to get the answer.

- Pay attention to the substring part.
