## 💡 Key Insight

This problem makes me feel stupid. I thought of recursion, pascal's triangle, and checking the cups needed to fill glasses from previous rows, but all of these seems complicated.

- key insight is to calculate the amount of water that flow through each glass, and do one by one simulation.
  The spill over will be equally flowing to the glass' two children.
