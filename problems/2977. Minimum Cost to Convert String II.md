## 💡 Key Insight

- need to be familiar with Trie
- Trie can be used to ID a string. It's fetching is in O(1) time, rather than hash, which can take O(n)
- remember to set dp[i][i] to 0 in floyd
- after ID the substring, construct the graph, precompute cost, and then do the DP on the actual problem
- DP is tricky, remember the special case of dp[i] when i = 0, which is when there is not dp before it.
