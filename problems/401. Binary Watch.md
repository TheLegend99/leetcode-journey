## 💡 Key Insight

I didn't realize the minute and hour number can be represented in binary. The number of turned on lights is the number of ones in the binary string.

- we can either enumerate the time, or numerate on the number of binary: we have 10 lights in total so that's 2^10 = 1024, enumerate on this.
